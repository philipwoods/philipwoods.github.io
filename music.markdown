# Choral Performance

I'm a founding member of OcTech, Caltech's independent choral octet.
[Check out our website](https://octech.sites.caltech.edu/)
for information about our performances, albums, and more.

I also perform with the Caltech Glee Club and the Caltech Chamber Singers.

# Compositions and Arrangements

I upload many of my compositions to my profile on Musescore.com [here](https://musescore.com/user/35973669)
or to my Youtube channel [here](https://www.youtube.com/@pdub9528).
PDFs of the scores are also available below.

## Nunc dimittis (2024)

Mixed choir SSAATTBB

[Score](/assets/compositions/Nunc_dimittis_20241124.pdf)

This unconventional setting of a very common choral text was born out of a chance encounter
with a person living with HIV. Hearing about their experience made me furious that the US
government, healthcare system, and God could have permitted such suffering as the AIDS crisis
of the 1980s. I suddenly saw the _Nunc dimittis_ text as accusatory rather than comforting,
and my anger and mourning poured out into this piece.

## An Irish Airman Foresees His Death (2024)

Mixed choir SATB

[Score](/assets/compositions/An_Irish_Airman_Foresees_His_Death_20240926.pdf)

As with several of my other compositions, I discovered this poem by William Butler Yeats
while browsing through public domain poetry. It created an interesting juxtaposition of
lightness while soaring through the air and somber consideration of imminent death that I
wanted to crystallize into music.

## A Place of Honor (2024)

Mixed choir SSAATTBB

[Score](/assets/compositions/A_Place_of_Honor_20241119.pdf)

For years, I and other members of OcTech have felt that the Sandia National Labs
long-term nuclear waste warning message, best known as an
[internet meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/this-place-is-not-a-place-of-honor)
is sufficiently creepy and compelling that it deserves to be set to music. As we
couldn't find existing settings of the text, I decided to make my own. I thought it
would be interesting to pair this warning of imminent danger with Psalm 23, a
biblical prayer for protection. The piece is structured with two opposing choirs,
one singing each of these two texts, acting as conflicting influences on a hypothetical
explorer in the long-distant future. This piece was premiered by OcTech as part of our
fall 2024 concert series _Consona_.

## Nothing Gold Can Stay (2024)

Mixed choir SATB

[Score](/assets/compositions/Nothing_Gold_Can_Stay_20240906.pdf)

I felt my composition _The Oak_ was too short to stand on its own, so I looked for
other short poems that might serve as the basis for a companion piece. I liked the
similar themes of growth and serenity in aging that these two poems shared, so I view
these two as a paired set.

## The Oak (2024)

Mixed choir SATB

[Score](/assets/compositions/The_Oak_20240906.pdf)

Continuing my composing journey, I began browsing online for public domain poetry that
I could set to music. This poem by Alfred Lord Tennyson caught my attention, and seemed
short enough that I wasn't overwhelmed by the idea of setting it to music.

## Quod chorus vatum (2024)

SA or TB duet

In an effort to learn more about the English Renaissance, I watched
[this wonderful online course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtV_CHZ0VsQey-CMfGf-FKGcXW2NFI-C7&si=r_-P8Yn7sfdsB5aH)
by Dr. Kerry McCarthy about Thomas Tallis and William Byrd. One of the musical
examples that came up throughout the course was the chant _Quod chorus vatum_
[performed by Gallicantus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQ3PDPklDqU). I found
myself humming this chant for a week and decided to put something down on paper
to get it out of my head.

## Tristitia et anxietas (2024)

Mixed choir SSATB

[Score](/assets/compositions/Tristitia_et_anxietas_20240906.pdf)

I discovered a love of the English Renaissance in college, where William Byrd's setting
of [_Tristita et anxietas_](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v4jtMj0DSJk) became a crucial
touchstone for me as I struggled with my mental health. After a hiatus from arranging, I
was looking for a way to restart my composing and this text seemed like a natural entry
point. I tried to emulate the style Renaissance polyphony, but ended up deviating from
typical practice of the period somewhat. This was my first fully original composition.

## Red is the Rose (2023)

Solo baritone and piano

[Score](/assets/compositions/Red_is_the_Rose_20230515.pdf)

I've had a long fascination with folk music, and a formative album for me during my
childhood was An Irish Evening by The Chieftains. That record includes a gorgeous
performance of the song _Red is the Rose_ by Nanci Griffith that I would often sing
along to. When the director of the Caltech Glee Club suggested to us members that we
should end the year with opportunities for solo performances, I knew I wanted to sing
this song. Our solos could be accompanied by our collaborative pianist Bill Schmidt, so
I stretched myself by writing for piano for the first time.

## Maria durch ein Dornwald ging (2023)

Mixed choir SSAATTBB

[Score](/assets/compositions/Maria_durch_ein_Dornwald_ging_20230323.pdf)

One of my favorite choirs, the [Gesualdo Six](https://www.thegesualdosix.co.uk/),
posted [this Youtube short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/eYF-wG06cCI) during the
2022 holiday season and it absolutely captivated me. I quickly tracked down several
versions of the song and combined my favorite sections from these arrangements before
adding my own original arrangement of the third verse. As noted in the sheet music,
this arrangement is heavily indebted to arrangements by Stephen Claas and Philip Lawson.
This arrangement was premiered by OcTech in our December 2023 concert series
[_Winter's Night_](https://octech.sites.caltech.edu/concerts/past-concerts/winters-night).

## Gaudete (2022)

Mixed choir SSAATTBB

[Score](/assets/compositions/Gaudete_a_8_20221112.pdf)

When OcTech began planning our 2022 holiday concert program, we found ourselves including
several very old tunes such as _The Holly and the Ivy_ and _Es ist ein Ros entsprungen_ in
addition to more modern classics. I wrote this arrangement, heavily inspired by the 6-part
arrangement performed by the King's Singers, to round out our collection of ancient holiday
songs. This arrangement was premiered by OcTech in our December 2022 concert series
[_Snow!_](https://octech.sites.caltech.edu/concerts/past-concerts/snow)

## Wild Mountain Thyme (2022)

Mixed choir SATBarB with baritone solo

[Score](/assets/compositions/Wild_Mountain_Thyme_20220530.pdf)

When I wrote this piece, I had just been listening to a lot of folk rock and psychedelic rock,
particularly Fairport Convention and The Byrds. After I heard The Byrds' recording of this
song, I couldn't get it out of my head. As chance would have it, my choir OcTech was in the
midst of planning a folk-inspired concert program, so I decided to arrange a version for us.
My arrangement was premiered by OcTech in our June 2022 concert series
[_Measure for Measure_](https://octech.sites.caltech.edu/concerts/past-concerts/measure-for-measure).
