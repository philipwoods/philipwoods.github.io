Sharing knowledge is one of my great joys as a scientist. I endeavor to make microbiological
ideas accessible and engaging to my students, and to encourage both their confidence and
curiosity about science.

During my time at Caltech, I have been a teaching assistant for an undergraduate evolution
class and a graduate microbial ecology class. In each class, I have had opportunities to
give guest lectures, lead interactive activities using resources like the famous
Caminalcules and the NetLogo software, and facilitated journal clubs discussing recent
research to provide practical context for the class lectures.
