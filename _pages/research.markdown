I am a geobiologist studying under Victoria Orphan at Caltech. As a lab, our
focus is on the symbiotic relationship between anaerobic methanotrophic
archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). Working together, these
two taxa convert methane and sulfate found at methane seep sites on the ocean
floor into carbon dioxide and sulfide. My part in our lab's work has primarily
investigated the evolution of ANME. By comparing the genomes of ANME and
related archaea, I have tried to piece together the different steps taken and
processes responsible for the evolution of methane-consuming ANME from their
methane-producing ancestors.

In my ongoing work, I want to focus on the evolution of novel metabolisms, with
a particular focus on anaerobic energy conservation and archaeal physiology.
My research interests broadly stem from two major themes:

1. How did life come to be the way we see it today? What drove different
metabolisms to evolve and diversify over the history of the Earth? How do
interactions with the environment and other members of the ecosystem influence
the evolution of life?

2. How is life able to accomplish difficult chemical reactions such as
nitrogen fixation and anaerobic methane oxidation? What metabolic tricks need
to be employed to make a living at the edge of thermodynamic viability?
